This package contains code and sample data for 3d Edwards-Anderson Model 
simulation for systems with NVidia GPUs. This code uses multi-spin coding
technique to store the spins and enhance performance, and Parallel tempering
technique to facilitate equilibration. 

Please refer to the following paper for more detailed description.

LA-SiGMA, the Louisiana Alliance for Simulation-Guided Materials
Applications, is a statewide interdisciplinary collaboration of
material and computer scientists developing computational resources
tuned for the latest generation of accelerator-equipped systems. The
Alliance also develops graduate curricula and is engaged in multiple
outreach activities. Visit us at http://lasigma.loni.org .

The accelerator ports of this code were developed by Ye Fang
<yfang11@tigers.lsu.edu>, Sheng Feng <sfeng4@tigers.lsu.edu> with the
assistance of Ka Ming Tam <phy.kaming@gmail.com>, Zhifeng Yun
